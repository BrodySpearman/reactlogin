## React Sign-up Page
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This is a simple and elegant demo for a sign-up page I designed as a weekend project. I created this in order to familiarize myself with using the Next.js framework
and React. If you try it please remember to not use any personal info. None of the information is stored on a server, due to the simple scope of the project.
Instead, non-sensitive user data is passed to a new page using cookies. Page is fully functional, including server-side client validation and logging out.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
